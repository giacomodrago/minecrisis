ABOUT

MineCrisis is a 3D action game. The player controls a spaceship; the aim
of the game is to reach all the checkpoints of the map within the
remaining time, preventing the spaceship from being destroyed by the
mines and the shots of the automatic turrets.



NEWS / CHANGELOG

2010-10-16        Version 0.91 beta released: fixed some minor issues,
                  added more info in the README, published builds for Linux
2010-10-14        Version 0.9 beta released



HOW TO PLAY

Reach all the checkpoints in the remaining time. The checkpoints are
represented by yellow intermittent spheres: everytime you reach a
checkpoint you get some extra time. Avoid hitting the mines (represented
by barely seeable magenta spheres), and try to dodge the turrets' shots by
continuously changing direction. The turrets are represented by black
shiny spheres that fire against the ship everytime it enters their
rifle-range.
The shield protects you from both mines and shots, but when it's out of
energy any damage will break your ship down.
Use the Afterburner (turbo) and the Invisibility abilities to elude
the automatic turrets.
NOTE: when you use invisibility you can't see the mines - at all.

     shield energy decreases when the spaceship hits a mine or gets
     hit by an automatic turret shot. It slowly recharges when idle.
2. Invisibility energy indicator:
     invisibility energy decreases when the invisibility ability is
     enabled and slowly recharges when it's disabled.
3. Afterburner (turbo) "fuel" indicator
     afterburner "fuel" gets consumed when the afterburner is engaged
     and slowly recharges when it's idle.
